    "    for song in log_of_songs:\n",

    "How would this work with parallel programming? Spark splits up data onto multiple machines.<br> \n",

    "In Spark, if the data is split onto two different machines, machine A will run a function to count how many times 'Despacito' appears on machine A. Machine B will simultaneously run a function to count how many times 'Despacito' appears on machine B. After they finish counting individually, they'll combine their results together."
